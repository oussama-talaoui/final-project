In the [report](https://oussama-talaoui.github.io/final-project/) page you can find the answers for the following questions:
### Abstract

- [X] A summary of our project and findings.

### Introduction and Related Work
An explanation of the problem and the motivation for solving it.

- [X] Provides a clear motivation for answering a _specific_ data driven question of interest
- [X] Cites 5 _relevant_ pieces of relevant work 

### Exploratory Data Analysis

- [X] Introduces the dataset by describing the origin (source) and structure (shape, relevant features) of the data being used
- [X] Creates 5 well designed and formatted graphics
  - The visual uses the appropriate visual encodings based on the data type
  - Written interpretation of graphic is provided
  - Clear axis labels, titles, and legends are included, where appropriate

### Methods
In this section, we described the appropriate analysis for answering our question of interest.  Provided a description of both the statistical and machine learning techniques used to answer our question of interest regarding strength of relationships and prediction of our outcome.

The appropriate methods are employed to answer the question of interest, including:

- [X] **Strength of relationships**: Uses the appropriate technique to assess the strength of relationships amongst our variables of interest. You should include: 
  - A formula describing how you believe our features (independent variables) are related to our outcome of interest (dependent variable)
  - A defense of the variables included in our formula
  - Creating the appropriate model based on our dataset
- [X] **Prediction**: You must also make predictions for our outcome of interest. In doing so, you must demonstrate a clear use of:
  - Splitting our data into testing/training data
  - Applying cross validation to our model
  - Appropriately handling any missing values
  - Appropriately using categorical variables
  - Using a grid search to find the best parameters for you model of interest
  - Employing the algorithm of interest

### Results
In this part we described the results of our analysis with clear interpretation of our statistical and machine learning results.

- [X] **Strengths of relationships**: For the features you included in our model, you must describe the strength (significance) and magnitude of the relationships. This can be presented in a table or chart, and pertinent observations should be described in the text.
- [X] **Predictions**: How well were you able to predict values in the dataset? You should both report appropriate metrics based on the type of outcome you're predicting (e.g., root mean squared error v.s. accuracy), as well as a high quality visual showing the strength of our model

### Discussion and Future Work
Real world implications of our results, and what further work should be done in our area of interest.

Based on _specific observations_ from the results section, the report clearly provides:

- [X] An analysis of the real world implications of the results, at least one full paragraph
- [X] Clear suggestion for directions of future research, at least one full paragraph

### Code Quality

- [X] We assured that our code is well commented, structured and organized across different files, as we included a Script.R file in the repository with all the code used for this project. As well as, some code snippet that we included to generat the analysis and visualizations in this report.
